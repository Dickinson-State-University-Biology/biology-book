The arctic fox is an example of a complex animal that has adapted to its environment and illustrates the relationships between an animalâ€™s form and function. The structures of animals consist of primary tissues that make up more complex organs and organ systems. Homeostasis allows an animal to maintain a balance between its internal and external environments.
