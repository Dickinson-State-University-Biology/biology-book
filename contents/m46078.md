# About Biology   {#import-auto-id1164193446666}

*Biology* is designed for multi-semester biology courses for science majors. It is grounded on an evolutionary basis and includes exciting features that highlight careers in the biological sciences and everyday applications of the concepts at hand. To meet the needs of today’s instructors and students, some content has been strategically condensed while maintaining the overall scope and coverage of traditional texts for this course. Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom. *Biology* also includes an innovative art program that incorporates critical thinking and clicker questions to help students understand—and apply—key concepts.

# Coverage and Scope   {#import-auto-id1164197739219}

Biology meets the scope and sequence of a typical two semester biology course for biology majors, pre-med majors, and science majors. In developing *Biology*, we listened to hundreds of General Biology instructors who readily provided feedback about their courses, students, challenges, and hopes for innovation. The expense of textbooks and related items did prove to be a barrier to learning. But more importantly, these teachers suggested improvements for the textbook, which would ultimately lead to more meaningful and memorable learning experiences for students.

The result is a book that addresses a core organizational reality of the course and its materials – the sheer breadth of the topical coverage. We provide a thorough treatment of biology’s foundational concepts while condensing selected topics in response to the market’s request for a textbook with a scope that is manageable for instructors and students alike. We also strive to make biology, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to students. In addition to a comprehensive coverage of core concepts and foundational research, we have incorporated features that draw learners into the discipline in meaningful ways.

The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with the feedback of another one hundred reviewers, who thoroughly read the material and offered detailed critical commentary.

* Unit 1: **The Chemistry of Life**. Our opening unit introduces students to the sciences, including the scientific method and the fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics that provide a framework within which learners comprehend biological processes.
* Unit 2: **The Cell**. Students will gain solid understanding of the structures, functions, and processes of the most basic unit of life: the cell.
* Unit 3: **Genetics**. Our comprehensive genetics unit takes learners from the earliest experiments that revealed the basis of genetics through the intricacies of DNA to current applications in the emerging studies of biotechnology and genomics.
* Unit 4: **Evolutionary Processes**. The core concepts of evolution are discussed in this unit with examples illustrating evolutionary processes. Additionally, the evolutionary basis of biology reappears throughout the textbook in general discussion and is reinforced through special call-out features highlighting specific evolution-based topics.
* Unit 5: **Biological Diversity**. The diversity of life is explored with detailed study of various organisms and discussion of emerging phylogenetic relationships. This unit moves from viruses to living organisms like bacteria, discusses the organisms formerly grouped as protists, and devotes multiple chapters to plant and animal life.
* Unit 6: **Plant Structure and Function**. Our plant unit thoroughly covers the fundamental knowledge of plant life essential to an introductory biology course.
* Unit 7: **Animal Structure and Function**. An introduction to the form and function of the animal body is followed by chapters on specific body systems and processes. This unit touches on the biology of all organisms while maintaining an engaging focus on human anatomy and physiology that helps students connect to the topics.
* Unit 8: **Ecology**. Ecological concepts are broadly covered in this unit, with features highlighting localized, real-world issues of conservation and biodiversity.

## Pedagogical Foundation and Features   {#import-auto-id1164187998914}

<em>Biology </em>is grounded on a solid scientific base and designed to help students understand the concepts at hand. Throughout the text, one can explore features that engage the students in scientific inquiry by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include:

* <strong>Evolution Connection </strong>features uphold the importance of evolution to all biological study through discussions like “The Evolution of Metabolic Pathways” and “Algae and Evolutionary Paths to Photosynthesis.”
* <strong>Scientific Method Connection </strong>call-outs walk students through actual or thought experiments that elucidate the steps of the scientific process as applied to the topic. Features include “Determining the Time Spent in Cell Cycle Stages” and “Testing the Hypothesis of Independent Assortment.”
* <strong>Career Connection </strong>features present information on a variety of careers in the biological sciences, introducing students to the educational requirements and day-to-day work life of a variety of professions, such as microbiologist, ecologist, neurologist, and forensic scientist.
* <strong>Everyday Connection </strong>features tie biological concepts to emerging issues and discuss science in terms of everyday life. Topics include “Chesapeake Bay” and “Can Snail Venom Be Used as a Pharmacological Pain Killer?”

## Art and Animations That Engage   {#import-auto-id1164230572827}

Our art program takes a straightforward approach designed to help students learn the concepts of biology through simple, effective illustrations, photos, and micrographs. <em>Biology </em>also incorporates links to relevant animations and interactive exercises that help bring biology to life for students.

* <strong>Art Connection </strong>features call out core figures in each chapter for student study. Questions about key figures, including clicker questions that can be used in the classroom, engage students’ critical thinking and analytical abilities to ensure their genuine understanding.
* <strong>Link to Learning </strong>features direct students to online interactive exercises and animations to add a fuller context and examples to core content.
